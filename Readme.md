# Objective of the task

~ To create a decision tree classifier and visualize it

# Conclusion

- This model has good accuracy of 100% in train data.
- This model has better accuracy of 93.33% in test data.
- The high accuracy in train data and the less accuracy in test data is termed as Variance.
- Variance is quite commmon in Decision Tree algorithm.
- In order to reduce variance we will be using Random Forest algorithm.
